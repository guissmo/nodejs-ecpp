\noindent The integer

q_{ {{ i }} } = {{ qi }}

}

\noindent is less than $2^{64}$, has no prime divisors less than $102$, and is a Baillie-Pomerance-Selfridge-Wagstaff pseudoprime.

\vspace{2em}
\noindent Since all such pseudoprimes less than $2^{64}$ are verified to be prime, then $q_{ {{ i }} }$ is prime.
